The Treasure Valley Vintage Computer Club is a Boise, ID based collective of vintage computing enthusiasts. Founded in 2025, the TVVCC meets every second Wednesday at 6:00 PM in the BSU Computer Science department in downtown Boise. Our loose mission involves sharing projects, getting help with your vintage treasures, and buying and selling your misfit computers.

Membership is free and open to the public, so feel free to join our Discord and drop us a line!
