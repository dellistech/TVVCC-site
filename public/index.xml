      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the initial version of our website! Our goal was to seek inspiration both from some of the vintage computers and interfaces from which our club takes its name, but also from some of the previous publications which made this hobby such a community focused one in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
